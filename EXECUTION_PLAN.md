## Communication Protocol

### Daily Sync
1. Each agent updates `coordinator/daily-status.md`
2. Report blockers in `coordinator/blockers.md`
3. Update task progress in this file
4. Commit changes with descriptive messages

### Integration Testing
- Tests go in `coordinator/integration-tests/`
- Each phase requires passing integration tests
- Coordinator reviews before phase completion

## Success Criteria
- Each phase must have 100% task completion
- All integration tests must pass
- No high-priority blockers remaining
- Code review approval from coordinator
