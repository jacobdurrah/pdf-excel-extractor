# Main Coordinator Execution Plan - PDF to Excel Extractor

## Overview
This plan coordinates 5 parallel agents to build the PDF to Excel Extractor with visual trust-building features, following the successful pattern from the spaced repetition tool.

## Human Prerequisites (Before Starting)

### Minimal Requirements (5 minutes):
1. **Review & Approve**: Read agent assignments and confirm project goals
2. **Say "Start"**: Launch the parallel agents
3. **Daily Check-in**: 10 minutes per day to review progress

### Automated by Agents:
- ✅ Development environment checks (Python/Node.js versions)
- ✅ Git already configured 
- ✅ Sample PDF already available: `Check-EFTInfo - 2023-11-15T055920.964.pdf`
- ✅ PyTesseract OCR (made optional - agents will check and adapt)
- ✅ Additional test PDFs (agents will generate synthetic ones)
- ✅ Code signing certificates (not needed for development)

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Agent Launch (Day 1)

### Human Tasks:
1. Review and approve agent assignments (5 min)
2. Confirm "start" to launch agents

### Coordinator Tasks (Automated):
```bash
# Environment checks
python3 --version || python --version
node --version
tesseract --version 2>/dev/null || echo "OCR is optional"

# Copy existing sample PDF
cp "Check-EFTInfo - 2023-11-15T055920.964.pdf" test-data/samples/

# Each agent will:
# - Check their specific requirements
# - Adapt to available versions
# - Report any issues in STATUS.md
```

### Launch 5 Parallel Agents:

```
Agent 1: PDF Processing Engine
- "Build PDF processing engine following AGENT-1-PDF-PROCESSING.md"
- "Implement extraction algorithms and confidence scoring"
- "Create STATUS.md in parallel-implementation-plans/status/"

Agent 2: UI Components & Visual Flow
- "Build UI components following AGENT-2-UI-VISUAL.md"
- "Implement split-screen, highlighting, and animations"
- "Use mock data until backend ready"

Agent 3: Excel Integration & Export
- "Implement Excel functionality per AGENT-3-EXCEL-INTEGRATION.md"
- "Build editable spreadsheet and export features"
- "Create mock Excel preview for testing"

Agent 4: Security & Trust Features
- "Implement security per AGENT-4-SECURITY-TRUST.md"
- "Build local-only processing, encryption, audit trails"
- "Coordinate with all agents on security requirements"

Agent 5: IPC Bridge & Integration
- "Build Electron-Python bridge per AGENT-5-IPC-INTEGRATION.md"
- "Create robust message passing system"
- "Document all communication protocols"
```

## Phase 2: Daily Coordination (Days 2-5)

4. Bug fixes
```

## Phase 4: Polish & Package (Days 8-10)

### Human Tasks:

#### Day 8: Testing & Refinement
1. Complete user journey test
2. Test all extraction modes
3. Verify data accuracy
4. Check all security features

#### Day 9: Packaging
1. Review app permissions
2. Test installer on clean system
3. Verify no dependencies missing
4. Approve for packaging

#### Day 10: Documentation & Release

### Integration Dependencies:
```
Agent 1 (PDF) ← → Agent 5 (IPC) ← → Agent 2 (UI)
                         ↓
                   Agent 3 (Excel)
                         ↓
                   Agent 4 (Security wraps all)
```

## Risk Management

### If Agent Delays:
1. Coordinator identifies critical path
2. Reassign blocked tasks
3. Use mock implementations
4. Focus on MVP features

### Integration Issues:
1. Test with mock data first
2. Create fallback options
3. Document known limitations
4. Plan fixes for v2
