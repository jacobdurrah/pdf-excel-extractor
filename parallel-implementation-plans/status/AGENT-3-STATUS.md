     - Cell updates
     - Row addition/deletion
     - Undo/redo with history tracking
     - Cell selection and editing states

5. **Create mock spreadsheet data**

   - Converts mock data to proper spreadsheet format with:
     - Cell type detection (text, number, currency, date)
     - Confidence scores for extracted data
     - Source tracking (extracted vs manual)
     - Header row styling

6. **Integration with MainLayout**
