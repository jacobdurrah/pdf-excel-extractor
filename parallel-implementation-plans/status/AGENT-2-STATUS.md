# Agent 2 Status: UI Components & Visual Flow

## Day 1 Progress (Completed)

### Tasks Completed ✅

1. **Environment Setup**
   - ✅ Checked Node.js version (v24.2.0 available - well above required 16+)
   - ✅ Successfully installed frontend dependencies with `npm install`
   - ✅ Installed pdfjs-dist for PDF rendering

2. **Component Directory Structure**
   - ✅ Created organized component directories:
     ```
     src/components/
     ├── layout/
     ├── pdf/
     ├── extraction/
     ├── visual/
     └── common/
     ```

3. **Core Components Implemented**
   - ✅ **MainLayout.jsx** - Split-screen layout with responsive design
   - ✅ **ResizableDivider.jsx** - Draggable divider between panels (20%-80% limits)
   - ✅ **PDFViewer.jsx** - PDF rendering component with PDF.js integration
   - ✅ **PageControls.jsx** - Navigation and zoom controls for PDF
   - ✅ **NavigationBar.jsx** - Top navigation with upload and extraction buttons

4. **Features Implemented**
   - ✅ Split-screen layout (PDF viewer on left, Excel preview on right)
   - ✅ Resizable panels with smooth dragging
   - ✅ PDF viewer with zoom controls (25% - 200%)
   - ✅ Page navigation controls
   - ✅ Clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS
   - ✅ Mock UI for Excel preview area

5. **Mock Data Created**
   - ✅ Created mockData/extractionData.js with:
     - Sample extraction fields with confidence scores
     - Mock Excel data structure
     - PDF info metadata

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Layout Architecture**
   - Used flexbox for responsive split-screen design
   - Implemented percentage-based widths for resizable panels
   - Added boundaries (20-80%) to prevent extreme resizing

2. **PDF.js Integration**
   - Configured PDF.js with CDN worker for optimal performance
   - Implemented error handling for PDF loading
   - Added loading states and error displays

3. **State Management**
   - Using local React state for UI interactions (resize, zoom, page nav)
   - Ready for Redux integration in later phases

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes
   - Gray-based color scheme with blue accents
   - Smooth transitions (200ms) for hover states
   - Clean shadows and borders for depth

### Current UI State

The application now shows:
- Navigation bar with title and action buttons
- Split-screen layout with PDF viewer and Excel preview panels
- Resizable divider between panels
- PDF viewer with zoom and page controls (shows placeholder when no PDF loaded)
- Excel preview area (ready for data integration)

### Integration Readiness

Ready for integration with:
- ✅ Agent 3 (Excel Preview) - Excel preview panel is prepared
- ✅ Agent 5 (IPC Bridge) - Structure ready for PDF upload and data flow
- ✅ Agent 4 (Extraction Engine) - Mock data structure defined

### Environment Adaptations

- No major adaptations needed
- Node.js version 24.2.0 exceeded requirements
- All dependencies installed successfully
- PDF.js configured with CDN worker

### Next Steps (Day 2)

Tomorrow's focus will be on PDF viewer enhancements:
- Implement highlight overlay system
- Add coordinate mapping for selections
- Enhance zoom functionality with fit-to-width
- Add pan and scroll features
- Create selection tools for manual field marking
