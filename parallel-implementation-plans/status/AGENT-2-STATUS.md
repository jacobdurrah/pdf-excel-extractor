# Agent 2 Status: UI Components & Visual Flow

## Day 2 Progress (Completed)

### Tasks Completed ✅

1. **Enhanced Zoom Controls**
   - ✅ Zoom controls already implemented (25% - 200%)
   - ✅ Added "Fit to Width" functionality
   - ✅ Smooth zoom transitions with proper canvas scaling

2. **Page Navigation**
   - ✅ Page navigation already functional
   - ✅ Previous/Next page buttons with disabled states
   - ✅ Page indicator showing current page and total pages

3. **HighlightOverlay Component**
   - ✅ Created HighlightOverlay.jsx for selection visualization
   - ✅ Support for multiple highlights with different colors
   - ✅ Interactive highlights with click handlers
   - ✅ Hover tooltips for highlight labels
   - ✅ Active highlight state with visual feedback

4. **Coordinate Mapping System**
   - ✅ Built bidirectional coordinate conversion (PDF ↔ pixel)
   - ✅ Scale-aware coordinate transformations
   - ✅ Page-specific highlight filtering
   - ✅ Proper positioning relative to canvas dimensions

5. **Pan and Scroll Functionality**
   - ✅ Middle-mouse button panning
   - ✅ Ctrl+Left click alternative for panning
   - ✅ Spacebar hold for pan mode
   - ✅ Visual cursor feedback (grab/crosshair)
   - ✅ Smooth scrolling within overflow container

6. **Selection Mode**
   - ✅ Toggle selection mode button in PageControls
   - ✅ Draw rectangle selections on PDF
   - ✅ Real-time selection preview
   - ✅ Minimum selection size validation (5x5 pixels)
   - ✅ Selection completion callback with PDF coordinates

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **HighlightOverlay Architecture**
   - Absolute positioning overlay matching canvas dimensions
   - Automatic dimension sync with PDF canvas on scale changes
   - Z-index management for active/inactive highlights
   - Group hover effects with CSS transitions

2. **Coordinate System**
   - PDF coordinates: Scale-independent, page-relative
   - Pixel coordinates: Scale-dependent, viewport-relative
   - Conversion formula: `pixelCoord = pdfCoord * scale`
   - Page-aware filtering for multi-page documents

3. **Interaction Modes**
   - Normal mode: Click highlights, scroll normally
   - Selection mode: Draw rectangles, crosshair cursor
   - Pan mode: Drag to scroll, grab cursor
   - Mode switching via UI buttons and keyboard shortcuts

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Event listener cleanup on unmount
   - Conditional rendering based on current page
   - Efficient coordinate calculations
   - Minimal re-renders with proper state management

### Enhanced Features

1. **User Experience**
   - Multiple interaction methods (mouse, keyboard)
   - Clear visual feedback for all modes
   - Tooltips and hover states
   - Disabled state handling

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Clean prop interfaces for components
   - Callback props for parent integration
   - Modular component structure
   - Consistent coordinate system

### Integration Points Enhanced

- **PDF Processor Integration**: Ready to receive highlight data with coordinates
- **Extraction Engine**: Can send selection coordinates for field extraction
- **Excel Preview**: Can correlate highlights with extracted data
- **IPC Bridge**: Selection events can trigger extraction requests

### Current State

The PDF viewer is now fully interactive with:
- Complete zoom and navigation controls
- Highlight overlay system for visualizing extractions
- Selection tools for marking areas
- Pan and scroll for large documents
- Coordinate mapping for accurate positioning

## Day 1 Progress (Completed)

### Tasks Completed ✅

1. **Environment Setup**
   - ✅ Checked Node.js version (v24.2.0 available - well above required 16+)
   - ✅ Successfully installed frontend dependencies with `npm install`
   - ✅ Installed pdfjs-dist for PDF rendering

2. **Component Directory Structure**
   - ✅ Created organized component directories:
     ```
     src/components/
     ├── layout/
     ├── pdf/
     ├── extraction/
     ├── visual/
     └── common/
     ```

3. **Core Components Implemented**
   - ✅ **MainLayout.jsx** - Split-screen layout with responsive design
   - ✅ **ResizableDivider.jsx** - Draggable divider between panels (20%-80% limits)
   - ✅ **PDFViewer.jsx** - PDF rendering component with PDF.js integration
   - ✅ **PageControls.jsx** - Navigation and zoom controls for PDF
   - ✅ **NavigationBar.jsx** - Top navigation with upload and extraction buttons

4. **Features Implemented**
   - ✅ Split-screen layout (PDF viewer on left, Excel preview on right)
   - ✅ Resizable panels with smooth dragging
   - ✅ PDF viewer with zoom controls (25% - 200%)
   - ✅ Page navigation controls
   - ✅ Clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS
   - ✅ Mock UI for Excel preview area

5. **Mock Data Created**
   - ✅ Created mockData/extractionData.js with:
     - Sample extraction fields with confidence scores
     - Mock Excel data structure
     - PDF info metadata

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Layout Architecture**
   - Used flexbox for responsive split-screen design
   - Implemented percentage-based widths for resizable panels
   - Added boundaries (20-80%) to prevent extreme resizing

2. **PDF.js Integration**
   - Configured PDF.js with CDN worker for optimal performance
   - Implemented error handling for PDF loading
   - Added loading states and error displays

3. **State Management**
   - Using local React state for UI interactions (resize, zoom, page nav)
   - Ready for Redux integration in later phases

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes
   - Gray-based color scheme with blue accents
   - Smooth transitions (200ms) for hover states
   - Clean shadows and borders for depth

### Current UI State

The application now shows:
- Navigation bar with title and action buttons
- Split-screen layout with PDF viewer and Excel preview panels
- Resizable divider between panels
- PDF viewer with zoom and page controls (shows placeholder when no PDF loaded)
- Excel preview area (ready for data integration)

### Integration Readiness

Ready for integration with:
- ✅ Agent 3 (Excel Preview) - Excel preview panel is prepared
- ✅ Agent 5 (IPC Bridge) - Structure ready for PDF upload and data flow
- ✅ Agent 4 (Extraction Engine) - Mock data structure defined

### Environment Adaptations

- No major adaptations needed
- Node.js version 24.2.0 exceeded requirements
- All dependencies installed successfully
- PDF.js configured with CDN worker

### Next Steps (Day 2)

Tomorrow's focus will be on PDF viewer enhancements:
- Implement highlight overlay system
- Add coordinate mapping for selections
- Enhance zoom functionality with fit-to-width
- Add pan and scroll features
- Create selection tools for manual field marking
