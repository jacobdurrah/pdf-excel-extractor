# Agent 4: Security & Trust Features - Status

## Day 1: Security Foundation ✅

### Completed Tasks

1. **Created `backend/app/security/` module** ✅
   - Comprehensive security module with all planned components
   - Clean, modular architecture for easy integration

2. **Implemented file sanitization and validation** ✅
   - `file_handler.py`: Secure file operations with validation
   - Validates file size, extension, and PDF magic bytes
   - Secure temporary file handling with automatic cleanup
   - Multi-pass secure deletion (default 3 passes)
   - Background cleanup thread for orphaned files

3. **Blocked all network requests in backend** ✅
   - `network_blocker.py`: Comprehensive network blocking
   - Blocks socket, SSL, urllib3, and requests
   - Auto-blocks on module import for security
   - Decorator for ensuring local-only operations
   - Network monitoring capabilities

4. **Set up secure temporary file handling** ✅
   - Secure temp directory with restricted permissions (0o700)
   - Context managers for safe file operations
   - Automatic cleanup on exceptions
   - File lifetime tracking and enforcement

5. **Created memory cleanup utilities** ✅
   - `memory_manager.py`: Memory monitoring and enforcement
   - Real-time memory usage tracking
   - Memory limit enforcement (default 500MB)
   - Background monitoring with configurable thresholds
   - Forced garbage collection on high usage
   - Memory-limited decorators and contexts

### Additional Implementations

6. **Audit Logger** ✅
   - `audit_logger.py`: Complete audit trail system
   - SQLite-based persistent storage
   - Indexed for fast queries
   - Automatic retention management
   - Context managers for operation tracking

7. **Encryption Module** ✅
   - `encryption.py`: Data encryption at rest
   - Fernet-based symmetric encryption
   - Session-based encryption management
   - File and string encryption support
   - Password-based key derivation

8. **Input Validators** ✅
   - `validators.py`: Comprehensive input validation
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Sensitive data detection (SSN, CC, email, phone)
   - Data masking capabilities
   - JSON validation with depth limits

9. **Security Wrapper** ✅
   - `security_wrapper.py`: Unified interface for all agents
   - Simple session management
   - Combined security operations
   - Easy integration pattern
   - Global security instance

10. **Usage Examples** ✅
    - `usage_example.py`: Clear integration guide
    - Example patterns for common operations
    - Best practices documentation

### Security Configuration

```python
SecurityConfig = {
    "max_file_size_mb": 100,
    "allowed_extensions": [".pdf"],
    "temp_file_lifetime_seconds": 3600,
    "memory_limit_mb": 500,
    "secure_delete_passes": 3,
    "audit_retention_days": 90
}
```

### Integration Points Ready

The security module is ready for integration with:
- ✅ File upload/download operations
- ✅ PDF processing pipeline
- ✅ Memory-intensive operations
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Audit trail for all actions

### Key Security Features Implemented

1. **Network Isolation**: All external network requests blocked
2. **File Security**: Validation, sanitization, secure deletion
3. **Memory Protection**: Limits and monitoring to prevent DoS
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all operations
5. **Data Protection**: Encryption and sensitive data detection
6. **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks

### How Other Agents Should Use

```python
from app.security import get_security

# Get security instance
security = get_security()

# Create session
session_id = security.create_session(user_id="user123")

try:
    # Process file securely
    result = security.process_with_security(
        session_id=session_id,
        file_path=pdf_path,
        process_func=your_processing_function,
        action="extract"
    )
finally:
    # End session
    security.end_session(session_id)
```

### Dependencies Added
- psutil: For memory monitoring
- cryptography: For encryption features

### Next Steps (Day 2)
- Design audit log schema for frontend display
- Create extraction history storage system
- Build history viewer components
- Implement revision tracking
