# Agent 1: PDF Processing Engine - Status Report

## Day 1 Status (2025-06-22)

### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Checked Python version (3.9.6 available)
- [x] Installed PDF processing dependencies with fallbacks
  - Poetry not found, used pip install successfully
  - Installed: pdfplumber, PyPDF2, openpyxl, and dependencies
- [x] Created `backend/app/services/pdf_processor.py`
- [x] Implemented basic PDF loading and text extraction
  - Primary method: pdfplumber
  - Fallback method: PyPDF2
- [x] Tested with sample PDF: `Check-EFTInfo - 2023-11-15T055920.964.pdf`
  - Successfully extracted 584 fields from 7 pages
  - Processing time: 0.08 seconds
- [x] Created data models for extraction results:
  - `BoundingBox`: Location tracking
  - `ExtractedField`: Individual field data
  - `ExtractionResult`: Complete extraction output
- [x] Wrote comprehensive unit tests (12 tests, all passing)
- [x] Created mock extraction data at `backend/app/mock_extraction.json`

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Pattern-based Field Detection**:
   - Check numbers: `#?\s*(\d{4,})`
   - Dates: Multiple formats supported
   - Currency amounts: With proper formatting
   - Phone numbers and emails

2. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Base pattern match score (0-40%)
   - Location score (0-20%)
   - Context score (0-20%)
   - Clarity score (0-20%)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful fallback from pdfplumber to PyPDF2
   - Proper error reporting and status tracking
   - Processing time measurement

### Current Blockers
- None

### Integration Readiness
- PDF processor service is ready for basic integration
- Mock data available for other agents
- API structure defined (implementation pending)

### Test Results
```
=================== 12 passed, 1 warning in 0.12s ===================
- Data model tests: 3 passed
- PDF processor tests: 8 passed
- Integration test: 1 passed
```

### Notes
- PyPDF2 shows deprecation warning (can migrate to pypdf later)
- OCR integration planned for Day 3 (Tesseract availability pending)
- Table extraction using camelot-py planned for Day 2

### Tomorrow's Tasks (Day 2)
- [ ] Implement table detection using camelot-py
- [ ] Enhance field detection algorithms
- [ ] Build confidence scoring system
- [ ] Handle multi-page PDFs more efficiently

## Day 2 Status (2025-06-22)

### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Installed camelot-py with opencv dependencies
- [x] Integrated security wrapper from Agent 4
  - Added session management support
  - Secure file operations with audit logging
  - Memory-limited operations
- [x] Enhanced field detection algorithms:
  - Check numbers with context awareness
  - Multiple date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, Month DD YYYY, etc.)
  - Currency amounts with various formats
  - Added SSN, routing numbers, account numbers
  - Names and addresses extraction
- [x] Implemented advanced confidence scoring:
  - Pattern match score (40%)
  - Location score based on proximity to keywords (20%)
  - Context score based on surrounding text (20%)
  - Clarity score based on value characteristics (20%)
- [x] Implemented table extraction:
  - Primary: camelot-py with lattice and stream modes
  - Fallback: pdfplumber table extraction
  - Automatic field detection in table data
- [x] Enhanced multi-page PDF handling
  - Processes all pages efficiently
  - Maintains page context for each field

### Test Results
- Successfully extracted from 7-page sample PDF:
  - 31 fields with average confidence 92.58%
  - 7 tables extracted with structure preserved
  - Processing time: 2.0 seconds (0.29s per page)
- Field types detected:
  - Amounts: 16 (100% confidence)
  - Dates: 13 (80-100% confidence)
  - Phone numbers: 2 (85% confidence)

### Key Enhancements
1. **Pattern Detection**:
   - Context-aware extraction
   - Multiple pattern support per field type
   - Duplicate removal with confidence preference

2. **Table Processing**:
   - Dual-mode extraction (lattice/stream)
   - Automatic field type identification
   - Structured data preservation

3. **Confidence Algorithm**:
   - Multi-factor scoring system
   - Context and location awareness
   - Field-specific clarity validation

### Current Blockers
- Minor deprecation warnings (PyPDF2, urllib3)
- Camelot accuracy values need calibration

### Integration Readiness
- Enhanced PDF processor ready for integration
- Security wrapper integration complete
- API structure supports secure sessions
- Mock data updated with real extraction results

### Tomorrow's Tasks (Day 3)
- [ ] Check Tesseract availability for OCR
- [ ] Implement OCR for scanned documents
- [ ] Create fallback for non-OCR extraction
- [ ] Optimize extraction speed
- [ ] Add more financial document patterns
