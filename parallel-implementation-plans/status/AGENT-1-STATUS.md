# Agent 1: PDF Processing Engine - Status Report

## Day 1 Status (2025-06-22)

### Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Checked Python version (3.9.6 available)
- [x] Installed PDF processing dependencies with fallbacks
  - Poetry not found, used pip install successfully
  - Installed: pdfplumber, PyPDF2, openpyxl, and dependencies
- [x] Created `backend/app/services/pdf_processor.py`
- [x] Implemented basic PDF loading and text extraction
  - Primary method: pdfplumber
  - Fallback method: PyPDF2
- [x] Tested with sample PDF: `Check-EFTInfo - 2023-11-15T055920.964.pdf`
  - Successfully extracted 584 fields from 7 pages
  - Processing time: 0.08 seconds
- [x] Created data models for extraction results:
  - `BoundingBox`: Location tracking
  - `ExtractedField`: Individual field data
  - `ExtractionResult`: Complete extraction output
- [x] Wrote comprehensive unit tests (12 tests, all passing)
- [x] Created mock extraction data at `backend/app/mock_extraction.json`

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Pattern-based Field Detection**:
   - Check numbers: `#?\s*(\d{4,})`
   - Dates: Multiple formats supported
   - Currency amounts: With proper formatting
   - Phone numbers and emails

2. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Base pattern match score (0-40%)
   - Location score (0-20%)
   - Context score (0-20%)
   - Clarity score (0-20%)

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful fallback from pdfplumber to PyPDF2
   - Proper error reporting and status tracking
   - Processing time measurement

### Current Blockers
- None

### Integration Readiness
- PDF processor service is ready for basic integration
- Mock data available for other agents
- API structure defined (implementation pending)

### Test Results
```
=================== 12 passed, 1 warning in 0.12s ===================
- Data model tests: 3 passed
- PDF processor tests: 8 passed
- Integration test: 1 passed
```

### Notes
- PyPDF2 shows deprecation warning (can migrate to pypdf later)
- OCR integration planned for Day 3 (Tesseract availability pending)
- Table extraction using camelot-py planned for Day 2

### Tomorrow's Tasks (Day 2)
- [ ] Implement table detection using camelot-py
- [ ] Enhance field detection algorithms
- [ ] Build confidence scoring system
- [ ] Handle multi-page PDFs more efficiently
