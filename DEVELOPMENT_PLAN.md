# Enhanced PDF-to-Excel Extraction Tool Development Plan

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Electron app with React for cross-platform desktop application
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for PDF processing (local-only, no cloud)
- **Security**: All processing happens locally, no external API calls
- **UI**: Split-screen with PDF viewer (left) and Excel preview (right)

## Key Improvements Added

### 1. Enhanced User Experience
- **Onboarding Tutorial**: Interactive walkthrough for first-time users
- **Extraction Templates**: Save/load extraction patterns for similar PDFs
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up workflow for power users
- **Dark Mode**: Reduce eye strain during extended use
- **Multi-language Support**: Accessibility for global users

### 2. Advanced Extraction Features
- **AI-Assisted Extraction**: Use local OCR for scanned PDFs
- **Table Detection**: Automatic identification of tabular data
- **Custom Field Mapping**: User-defined extraction rules
- **Batch Processing**: Queue multiple PDFs with same template
- **Data Validation Rules**: Pre-defined formats (dates, currency, etc.)

### 3. Trust & Transparency
- **Extraction Confidence Scores**: Visual indicators (color-coded)
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Original vs extracted data
- **Extraction History**: Track all changes and corrections
- **Learning System**: Improve accuracy based on corrections
- **Export Audit Report**: Document extraction process

### 4. Security Enhancements
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: No data leaves the machine
- **Memory Wiping**: Secure cleanup after processing
- **File Shredding**: Optional secure deletion of processed PDFs
- **Encrypted Local Database**: For templates and history
- **Activity Logging**: Local audit trail for compliance
